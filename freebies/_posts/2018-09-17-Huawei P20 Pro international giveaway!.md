# Huawei P20 Pro international giveaway!

 For starters, these are some of the most eye-catching devices Android Authority have seen so far. Both models *(P20 and P20 Pro)* are available in a few different colors, but the **P20 Pro** comes in a unique twilight edition that features a **glossy blue-to-purple** gradient that **changes tone** depending on the **lighting condition**. That’s not the only reason the P20 Pro will be a head-turner, either. The higher-end model comes with **three rear-facing cameras at 20, 8, and 40MP**. The 20MP and 40MP cameras do lack OIS, but Huawei says its AI-assisted stabilization will make up for users’ shaky hands.

 These are Huawei’s first 2018 flagships, so both phones have some killer under-the-hood specifications, too. The **P20** comes with a **5.8-inch** Full HD+ **LCD** display, **4GB of RAM**, and a **3,400mAh** battery, while the **P20 Pro** sports a **6.1-inch Full** HD+ **OLED** display, **6GB of RAM**, and a **4,000mAh battery**. Both devices are powered by Huawei’s **Kirin 970 SoC**, which can also be found in the **Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro**.

 This week we are giving away a brand new **Huawei P20 Pro**, courtesy of the **Android Authority App!**
 This giveaway ends **Saturday, September 22**, 2018 @ 04:00 p.m. UTC.
